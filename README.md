This repo contains a notebook that implements the mixed membership time dependent stochastic role model method described in _Name of paper_, using a two-step gradient descent method. The notebook does not make any explicit reference to equations on the paper, and therefore can be read independently. The paper, however, sets the context in which the notebook makes sense.

A self-contained library containing the algorithm and the plotting functions can be found `lib` folder.
